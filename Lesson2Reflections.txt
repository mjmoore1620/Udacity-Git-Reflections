What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    It creates a hidden folder: .git. This creates the files necessary to track the meta-data that git tracks. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a temporary space to see which files will be affected by a commit. The pwd and repo probably contain files that won't be affected by committing current changes. 
    The staging area allows for seperation of concerns.
