What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    It creates a hidden folder: .git. This creates the files necessary to track the meta-data that git tracks. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a temporary space to see which files will be affected by a commit. The pwd and repo probably contain files that won't be affected by committing current changes. 
    The staging area allows for seperation of concerns.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    Try to have one file in the staging area for each commit. More than one file change suggests more than one logical change most of the time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    Branches would be useful for experimental or alternate features. Branching helps keep a master version intact to keep a current working version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    It shows whats available from the perspective of a given commit, and also clearly shows the order.
