When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm working with a team or working on different machines. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might not be ready to resolve potential conflicts. The behavior of a program might change that I'm not ready to deal with. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are a copy of a repository. Forks are a clone ran and stored on the Github servers. Branches are a lineage of commits from the current head of whatever branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The repo is as up to date as it could be without internet. The branch can be reset without internet access. I can diff changes without using the internet to fetch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'd use google drive to share files and some kind of chat room to communicate. Opening files would be easier and there would be less password management. Maintaining the order that git enforces would be near impossible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'm working on a new feature that might interfere with master functionality or when I'll need other people's approval to affect the master branch. Making changes directly to master is more straight-forward, while using branches is more collaboration and experimentation friendly.
